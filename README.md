# Delphibrillator

Welcome to the most ambitious crossover of ***ground-braking*** technologies (see list below) paired with (the *fantastic* idea of using) all kind of programming languages. This project began some years ago and was paused shortly after. Now that we have overcome the pain and anxiety one usually develops when using Delphi/Object Pascal we pulled all our inner strength and started again from the beginning.

The following list shows concepts/technologies that could be used, everything that does not find its way in the code will be used in the story.

### Concepts

* Block chain
* Artificial Intelligence
* Virtual Reality
* Augmented Reality
* Data Mining
* Dark Data
* Dark/Deep Web
* and many more \*




\*  placeholder because i cant think of more right now
